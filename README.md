# symb_math
### A library for symbolic math calculations 
This library provides you with the tools to create mathematical functions in one variable and do basic computations with them, like simplifying, evaluating, taking the derivative and evaluating finite integrals.

### Roadmap
-   The API of this library is frozen.
-   Version numbers adhere to [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

The only accepted reason to modify the API of this package is to handle issues that can't be resolved in any other reasonable way.
